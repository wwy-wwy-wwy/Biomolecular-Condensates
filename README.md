# Condensate Speckle

This package is designed to study the decay behaviour of FUS protein. We start with an autoregressive model for timeseries to extract the decay time from intensity fluctuations at some certain points and will then study the correlation function. Ultimately, mapping out the decaying behavior with respect to aging time and position in the condensate provides a deeper insight into the liquid-to-transition mechanism.
