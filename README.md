# Condensate Speckle

### Anqi Chen, Wenyun Wang, Hanyue Wang

This package is designed to study the decay behaviour of FUS protein. It utilizes a first-order autoregressive model for timeseries to extract the decay time from intensity fluctuations at some certain points, and then gives the correlation function. Ultimately, the package can be used to map out the decay behavior with respect to aging time and position in the condensate. 

Notebook documentation.py will provide tutorial for usage of the package.
